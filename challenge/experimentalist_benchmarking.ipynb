        "- The package name must be ``autora-experimentalist-yourexperimentalist``\n",

        "\n",
        "- Teams will be ranked based on the final fit to a ground-truth model. Observations will be sampled across the entire domain of the ground-truth model. The rank will be accumulated across all benchmarking challenges. The team with the best accumulated rank will win a prize at the end of the workshop.\n",
        "- The teams must provide a **brief presentation** (less than 5 minutes) of their experimentalist just before the final evaluation. You may use [this template for your slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qCKqH9uXkQmGqDmROh1Jn4UcauALkMRhqlbAHubns2Q/edit?usp=sharing).\n",
